Make sure you are in the correct directory. You will not automatically start in your Desktop. You will have to `navigate` there.
Think about it like clicking through directories and windows. 
You can do this is Python using the `OS` library. 
Example 1:
Check working directory
>>> import os
>>> os.getcwd()
'/Users/andrewakhlaghi'
For windows

Example 2:
Get list of files and subdirectories in a directory 
>>> os.listdir()
Did you get an error? Are you using python2 or python3?

python2 
>>> dir=os.getcwd() # this declares a variable contains your current working directory 
>>> os.listdir(dir)

python3
>>> os.listdir()


Example 3: 
Change working directory via relative path #If the directory is in your working directory
>>> os.chdir('Desktop')
>>> os.getcwd()
'/Users/andrewakhlaghi/Desktop'

Example 4: 
Change working directory via absolute path # if the directory is outside of your working directory 
>>> os.chdir('/Users/andrewakhlaghi/Desktop/Programs')
>>> os.getcwd()
'/Users/andrewakhlaghi/Desktop/Programs'

Example 5:
If you want to move a files: 
>>> import shutil 
>>> shutil.move(SOURCE_FILE, DESTINATION_FILE) # you can also use the shutil.copy or os.rename commands

Example 6:
get names of all files in directory
>>> os.listdir()

Example 7:
print all names in a readable way 
>>> import pprint
>>> pp=pprint.PrettyPrinter()
>>> pp.pprint(os.listdir())
